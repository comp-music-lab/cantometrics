# MDS Interpretations

## Cantometrics Interpretations

![cantometrics_mds](/Users/hideodaikoku/Documents/Comp Music/Cantometrics/ISMIR 2020/figs/cantometrics_mds.png)

* Clustering around 15, 30, 28 and 29 : Group Singing
* Clustering around 1, 13, 24, 27, 23: More Melodic Group Singing/ Polyphonic
* Clustering around 14, 9, 5, 25, 10: Vocal Blend
* Clustering around 8, 3, 26: No clear reason.

* Clustering around 11,20,18.23 : High pitch, timbral similarity. (Sounds like music from a hollywood cowboy movie)
* Clustering around 24, 27, 13, 1: Clear vocal blending simiarlities
* Clustering around 28, 29, 30, 

## Panteli Interpretations

* Clear outlier with 20 (Throat singing, unique timbre)
* Clustering around 30, 15, 27,17,11,12,1 (30, 27 and 15 for instrumentation, rest for timbre)
* CLustering around 24,13,6,19 (Group Singing)
* Clustering around 7,8,2 (Similar Timbre)
* Clustering around 29,21 (High Pitch)

Cannot Explain 11, 12, 21, 26. Hard to interpret clustering

## Musly Interpretations

![musly_mds](/Users/hideodaikoku/Documents/Comp Music/Cantometrics/ISMIR 2020/figs/musly_mds.png)

* Clustering around 22, 23, 12 Clearly similar timbre
* CLustering around 18, 6 No apparent link
* Clustering around 1,13: Slight timbral similarity
* Clustering around 7,19: No clear link
* Isolation of 21: Has similarities in group link.. cannot see any reason for poor clustering.



## Metric Learning Interpretations

* 11,4,22 Similar Harmony? Not too clear
* 21,9,10 Similar Timbre? Not too clear
* 20,27 Solo Voice, but should cluster with other solo voice tracks like 19, etc.
* 19,29 Polyphony?
* 7.23  Harmony
